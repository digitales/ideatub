7. Current State Summary
   • Product direction: clearly defined around valuation + risk intelligence
   • Pricing & positioning: freemium → paid report → trade subscription ladder
   • Data contracts: vehicles/tests/defects parquet schemas established
   • Build system: working flatten, registry, and insight pipelines in place
   • Known issue: registry deduplication / primary key strategy needs refinement

Overall, the project has moved from concept into a solid, scalable data foundation, with the next phase focused on data integrity fixes and first real risk‑scoring logic.
