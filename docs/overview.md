Executive / Investor Summary

Vinlytics is a UK vehicle intelligence platform combining valuation with data-driven risk profiling built on DVSA MOT history at scale.

The problem
• Vehicle prices alone do not reflect ownership risk (repeat MOT failures, defect patterns, age/mileage traps).
• Trade buyers and consumers lack a fast, explainable way to quantify this risk before purchase.

The solution
• Vinlytics adds a Risk Profile alongside valuation, using national MOT data to surface:
• defect frequency and severity
• model-level reliability patterns
• age and mileage risk inflection points
• Delivered as instant reports and trade tools, with explainable metrics rather than black-box scores.

Why it wins
• Built on full-history MOT data, not small samples
• Scalable analytics pipeline (Parquet + DuckDB)
• Clear upgrade path: free → paid report → recurring trade subscriptions

Commercial model
• Free teaser valuation
• One-off detailed report (~£2.99–£3.99)
• Trade subscriptions (£29–£199+)

Current status
• Core data platform built and operational
• Registry and insight pipelines live
• One known blocker (registry deduplication) before full production load

Commercial direction
