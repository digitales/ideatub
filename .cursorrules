# Project-Wide Cursor Rules

This file provides general context and guidelines for working with this codebase.

## Project Overview

This is **Vinlytic** - a Laravel + Vue.js + Inertia.js application for vehicle analytics and valuation.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Laravel 12 (PHP 8.2+)
- **Frontend**: Vue 3 + TypeScript + Inertia.js
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4
- **Database**: SQLite (development), PostgreSQL (production)
- **Queue**: Laravel Queues with Redis
- **Testing**: Pest (PHP)

## Key Conventions

- Follow Laravel conventions for controllers, models, and services
- Use TypeScript for all frontend code
- Service layer pattern: Controllers delegate to Services
- Use DTOs for structured data transfer
- Document architectural decisions in `/decisions`
- Write specs before implementation in `/specs`
- Document implementation details in `/dev`
- Document customer support investigations in `/support`

## Directory-Specific Agents

This project uses specialized agents for different types of work:

- **Architect Agent** (`/decisions/.cursorrules`): For architectural decisions
- **Specs Agent** (`/specs/.cursorrules`): For technical specifications
- **Dev Agent** (`/dev/.cursorrules`): For implementation notes
- **Support Agent** (`/support/.cursorrules`): For customer support investigations

See `AGENT_CONFIGURATION.md` for details on using these agents.

## Code Style

- PHP: Laravel Pint (automatically formats on save)
- JavaScript/TypeScript: ESLint + Prettier
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Write tests for new features
