# Committing Agent Configurations

## ✅ Yes, commit everything!

All agent configuration files should be committed to source control:

- ✅ `.cursorrules` files
- ✅ README files  
- ✅ Decision records
- ✅ Example files (as templates)

This ensures the entire team uses consistent agent behaviors and documentation formats.

## Quick Start for New Team Members

1. Clone the repository
2. The `.cursorrules` files automatically configure Cursor
3. Read `AGENT_CONFIGURATION.md` in the project root
4. Start using agents by navigating to directories or referencing them in prompts

## Benefits

- **Consistency**: Everyone follows the same documentation standards
- **Onboarding**: New team members get productive faster  
- **Collaboration**: Team can improve configurations together
- **Knowledge**: Agent configs encode team best practices
